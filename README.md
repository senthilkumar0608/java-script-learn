HTML Structure: The HTML structure remains mostly unchanged. The div containing the ion-icon remains the same.

CSS Styling: A small change to the CSS is the addition of cursor: pointer; to indicate the div is clickable.

JavaScript Functionality:

An array of icon names (icons) is created to hold different icon names.
A click event listener is added to the iconContainer. When the container is clicked, the icon name changes to the next one in the array, and the background color changes to a random color.
The getRandomColor function generates a random hex color.
